  ### Installation 
  Clone the repo, and use npm i to install jest and inquirer dependencies.
  
  ### Usage 
  Navigate to the folder containing index.js and use NodeJs' node index command to run the application. There will be a series of prompts for the user to fill in. NOTE: This application currently does not include data validation, so it will happily accept nonsense email addresses and github profile names. User beware.
  
  ### Contributing 
  Contribute as you see fit, within the confines of the application license
  
  ### Tests 
  There is a test file which uses Jest (another dependency) which confirms the class constructors are behaving as intended. After installing jest with npm i jest, use npm test to run it. Beyond that, test as you see fit!
